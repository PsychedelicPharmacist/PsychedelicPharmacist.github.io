                    <h3>Mike Bonertz's Professional Background</h3>
                    <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of Alberta in 2010 and have since developed comprehensive treatment plans in cooperation with local physicians, nurse practitioners, and health care teams for thousands of patients throughout British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Arctic in the Northwest Territories.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I have been blessed with opportunities to wear countless hats and play critical roles in numerous organizations, businesses, and institutions. I've always held close to my heart a strict system of personal beliefs, ethics, morals, intentions, and values that guide me safely through my professional healthcare journey.</p>

                    <h3>Meet Harm Reduction Advocate Mike</h3>
                    <p>Mike is the Founder and President of Responsible Empowered Living, Inc. (R.E.L.), a Psychedelic Harm Reduction Organization.</p>
                    <p>Though R.E.L. was founded in 2023, Mike has been preparing for his role as a Harm Reduction Advocate for his entire life.</p>
                    <p>My home is nestled deep within the rocky mountains of Canada's beautiful and rugged British Columbia province in the stunning Lillooet community on traditional Stʼatʼimc territory. There are six communities here that I would like to take this time to acknowledge and express gratitude for: I am truly blessed to live, work and play on these traditional and unceded lands which have been inhabited and cared for since pre-contact and time immemorial by members of Tsaľálh (Shalalth), Sekw'el'wás (Pashilqua), Tʼítʼq'et (Tl'itl'kt), Nxwísten (Bridge River), Xa'xlip (Fountain), and Tsk'weylecw (Pavilion).</p>
                    <p>I dream of learning more about and incorporating traditional St'at'imc healing into my and my patients' lives here, now and forever. I yearn for a future where people can utilize all sacred natural medicines from our beautiful and healing planet to be cured. Working with these exceptionally powerful earth tools has given me hope for a brighter future—for myself, my patients, and the planet itself.</p>

                    <h3>Patient Becomes Practitioner</h3>
                    <p>Why might a lifelong career pharmacist be interested in plant therapies and psychedelic medicines? Nothing else has worked.</p>
                    <p>I have been diagnosed with MDD/TRD/PDD (major depressive disorder/treatment-resistant depression/persistent depressive disorder), GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), OCPD (obsessive compulsive personality disorder), ASD (autism spectrum disorder), and Personality Disorder Otherwise Unspecified. And I've tried everything available from Western medical channels for these mental health woes.</p>
                    <p>I've seen countless doctors and multiple psychiatrists. I have been trialed on (and have failed) almost every psychoactive pharmaceutical on the market over the past two decades of my life.</p>
                    <p>Before becoming weary of this multi-decade-long trial of one prescription after another, there was always the hope that this tablet or that capsule would do what it says it does without causing irreparable or intolerable side effects.</p>
                    <p>But the same cycle appeared repeatedly: we'd add this or up that, and … I'd become resistant. Or it wouldn't work at all. Or I'd have side effects more terrible than the condition itself.</p>
                    <p>I was tired of constantly chasing the pharma dragon but never really getting anywhere. And then, I tried cannabis and other psychedelic earth medicines. It was like someone turned the light on in the dark room I had been ensconced in for years.</p>
                    <p>I anticipate that many others may feel similarly hopeless after having gone through similar medication gauntlets. And I feel like others may also gain hope again once they realize the potential of these powerful psychedelic substances.</p>
                    <p>When we are sick, we hope for a brighter future, hope for a morning without feeling unwell. With the advent of psychedelic therapies becoming widely available, I have hope again. Don't get me wrong; I am not fully healed. I may never be. But, for the first time in a long time, I have hope.</p>
                    <p>As Harm Reduction Advocate, I hope to disseminate my knowledge on and experience with psychedelics to folks looking for this same crucial hope.</p>

                <div class="about-section">
                    <h3>Additional Expertise</h3>
                    <p>I am a Cannabis Consultant, Psychedelic Pharmacist, and natural earth medicine enthusiast who strives to practice the principles of two-eyed seeing and reciprocity daily in both my personal and professional life. I was trained by and am a member of the International Society of Cannabis Pharmacists. I hope to continue working with this healing earth medicine personally and with my patients. This is why I am continually available for cannabis also!</p>
                    <p>The renewed interest in psychedelic medicines and the addition of MDMA, psilocybin (twice), and now LSD to the list of breakthrough drugs in the United States just shows how close we are to being able to use psychedelics regularly therapeutically here in Canada. A few years maximum, I would guess, since the breakthrough drugs are allowed to speed through various regulatory and legislative hurdles. These may be better than other therapies in some cases for some people, so the intention is to get them to market as quickly as possible to help as many people as possible. Multiple different psychedelics - hopefully a massive variety of soon fully legal, newly rescheduled, and widely available substances available for healing again for humans - and all for the first time since the 1970s!</p>
                    <p>With the reintroduction of psychedelic therapies into standard treatment practices, I hope to personally be able to provide much greater social utility and healing potential through proper application and dissemination of my extensive knowledge of these substances.</p>
                    <p>I know that everyone has had their fair share of difficulties and stumbling blocks. I look forward to hearing more about your challenges and sharing more about mine if it helps you to know you are not alone in this world.</p>
