                    <p>This website aims to provide a significant amount of information and resources for an aspiring psychedelic enthusiast. On this page you'll find expertly curated scientific literature providing evidence on the positive impact of psychedelic-assisted therapy and mental illness as well as the history of prohibition and the harms that this has caused to present day civilization.</p>
                    <p>People seeking information about potential research participation or future treatment options for themselves or loved ones may find valuable information here about both demonstrated benefits and possible risks of psychedelic therapies, allowing them to consider whether one or another medication or approach may be suitable for their healing journey.</p>
                    <p>Our Harm Reduction Advocate, Mike Bonertz, is also happy to examine the abundant research together, or answer any burning psychedelic research questions you may have during a consultation.</p>

                    <p>You really cannot work towards an actual solution until you take a fair look at what is actually going on first, and to do this you have to understand the past. Why are these drugs illegal in the first place?</p>

                        <blockquote>"A new study has found that people who have taken a classic psychedelic even once have a 'lower incidence of heart disease and diabetes'…"</blockquote>
                        <p>The researchers suspect that it is that psychedelic use promotes a healthier lifestyle through behavioral changes. Since ancient times, practitioners of traditional medicine across the globe have turned to plants and fungi with psychedelic properties in the hopes of healing the mind and spirit. New research suggests a link between psychedelics and a healthy body, as well.</p>
                        <p>The research follows an earlier analysis of the same data which "found associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and lower odds of being overweight, as well as lower odds of having hypertension in the past year."</p>
                        <p>Data suggests that "classic psychedelics could have both direct and indirect effects that lead to better cardiometabolic health."</p>

                        <h3>Cancer and Psychedelics</h3>
                        <p>We know that psychedelics are effective in treating existential distress due to death and dying, but there is new evidence that psychedelic therapies may also assist with treating and even curing the cancer itself.</p>
                        <p>Evidence suggests that psychedelic use may lower cancer risk - as well as benefiting physical health - stating that: "The association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months approached conventional levels of significance, with lower odds of having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months for respondents who had tried a classic psychedelic at least once…"</p>
                        <p>There is ample evidence for ayahuasca's anti-cancer effects. "Human clinical studies showed that ayahuasca can alter the number and distribution of blood immune cells in a way that can increase the antiviral and anti-tumor immunity of the consumer."</p>
                        <h4>Case Study: Combining Chemotherapy with Psilocybin and Cannabis</h4>
                        <p>A study published in the journal Drug Science, Policy and Law found that a breast cancer patient may have put the disease into remission by taking cannabis oil and magic mushrooms alongside her course of traditional chemotherapy.</p>
                        <p>The patient, a 49-year old woman named Nicole DiMonda, was diagnosed in 2018 with stage IV breast cancer that had metastasized to her lymph nodes, liver and bones. With this bleak prognosis, she was quickly put on a course of chemotherapy. However, she decided, personally, to also begin taking both cannabis oil and psilocybin microdoses.</p>
                        <p>After several months of these treatments, DiMonda was tested again. The doctors were perplexed to find that all of her tumors had disappeared. The chemotherapy was halted, but she continued to take the psilocybin and cannabis oil. Seven months later, tested again, her cancer was still gone.</p>

                        <h3>MDMA for PTSD: Breakthrough Therapy Coming in 2024</h3>
                        <p>"Thanks to the work of MAPS over the past 35 years, MDMA-assisted therapy for the treatment of PTSD is poised to be the first legally accessible Schedule I psychedelic-assisted therapy. It is estimated this could happen as early as late 2024."</p>
                        <p>The evidence is overwhelming:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>MDMA was awarded 'breakthrough therapy' status by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of PTSD in order to accelerate the drug development process.</li>
                            <li>Research into the use of MDMA to treat PTSD has reached Phase III of the clinical trial process.</li>
                            <li>The results of this trial found that over half of the participants who received MDMA no longer qualified for PTSD diagnosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>No longer qualified for a diagnosis? What other drugs on the psychiatry market compare to this? Breakthrough indeed.</p>
                        <p>Researchers at MAPS conducted six Phase II trials using MDMA-assisted therapy to treat PTSD. Across the studies, researchers observed significant and sustained decreases in PTSD symptoms. A pooled analysis of the results of these six trials showed MDMA-assisted therapy had a very large effect, with 56% of participants no longer meeting the criteria for PTSD. Moreover, improvements in symptoms were sustained 1 to 3.8 years post-treatment.</p>

                        <h3>Psychedelics and Environmental Connection</h3>
                        <p>A fascinating area of research is showing how psychedelics might help address the growing disconnection between humans and the natural world:</p>
                        <p>"Humans appear to be becoming ever more disconnected from the natural world, and this sense of disconnection is linked to poor mental health as well as ecological neglect and destruction. Urbanisation is increasing globally and this may be acting to cut people off from nature."</p>
                        <p>Several recent studies have observed how psychedelics can catalyze measurable and enduring increases in people's feelings of nature connectedness, or relatedness. This is particularly important as "a broad range of mental illnesses, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar personality disorder, and eating disorders have been linked to feelings of psychological or social disconnection."</p>
                        <p>Research has found "a strong relationship between the amount of lifetime use of psychedelics and nature relatedness, as well as increases in nature relatedness from before to after psychedelic use, assessed in a prospective way. The observed increase in nature relatedness post-psychedelic use was correlated with concomitant increases in psychological wellbeing and remained significantly elevated two years after the psychedelic experience."</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="evidence-category">
                        <h3>Psychedelics and Spirituality</h3>
                        <p>The spiritual dimensions of psychedelic experiences may be central to their therapeutic effects:</p>
                        <p>"In a widely reported trial published in December 2016, the degree to which cancer patients saw a decrease in anxiety, depression, and a fear of death directly correlated with the intensity of their mystical experience on psilocybin."</p>
                        <p>Similarly, in a six-month follow-up with cigarette smokers who underwent psilocybin sessions, the greater their mystical experience, the less they reported cravings to smoke afterward.</p>
                        <p>Johns Hopkins has also studied the effects of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. In these trials, the data shows that mystical experiences give rise to positive changes in mood, altruism, forgiveness, and interpersonal closeness.</p>
                        <p>Two-thirds or more of the participants rate one of their sessions among the top five most meaningful experiences of their life alongside events such as the birth of a first child.</p>
                        <p>As researchers point out, psilocybin only lasts about eight hours, but the effects of it persist for years. This means it's likely not the drug itself, but the memory of the experience on the drug that is increasing people's well-being.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="evidence-category">
                        <h3>Social Benefits and Crime Reduction</h3>
                        <p>Research suggests psychedelics may have broader societal benefits beyond individual health:</p>
                        <p>"Magic mushrooms have been linked to lower crime rates" - Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that people who have taken drugs like magic mushrooms, LSD, or DMT, are statistically less likely to steal or assault anyone.</p>
